## Steps for Performance Testing with API
1. Choose a Performance Testing Tool:
    - Select a tool for performance testing. Popular tools include Apache JMeter, Artillery, k6, and Locust.

2. Define Test Scenarios:
    - Identify the key API endpoints you want to test. For your application, this would include the /upload, /async-upload, and /uploads/:filename endpoints.
    Define the test scenarios, such as uploading images, retrieving images, and handling concurrent requests.

3. Set Up the Testing Tool:
    - Configure the testing tool with the test scenarios. This involves setting up the requests, specifying the payloads (e.g., image files), and defining the number of concurrent users and the duration of the test.

4. Run the Tests:
    - Execute the performance tests and monitor the results. Look for metrics such as response times, throughput, error rates, and resource utilization.

5. Analyze the Results:
    - Analyze the test results to identify performance bottlenecks and areas for improvement. Focus on endpoints with high response times or error rates.

6. Optimize and Retest:
    - Make necessary optimizations to your application based on the test results. Retest to verify that the optimizations have improved performance.
